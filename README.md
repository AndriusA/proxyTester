ProxyTester
===========

ProxyTester was created to investigate the current state of proxies and other middleboxes in today's Internet.

In addition to this online interface showing aggregated and anoymised data, it provides a network analysis tool which:
- Detects proxies on a number of popular communication ports: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, IMAPS, FTP, etc.
- Determines the user's local and global IP addresses, as well whether a particular network provides global addresses to individual users
- Detects whether port numbers typically used for secure communication (SSL, HTTPS, IMAPS) are interfered with
- Runs a series of diagnostic tests on popular port numbers for the TCP protocol, checking for further traces of packet rewriting and modifications
